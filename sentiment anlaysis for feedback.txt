Sentiment analysis is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique that helps determine the emotional tone or sentiment of a piece of text, typically classifying it as positive, negative, or neutral. It works by analyzing text data such as reviews, social media posts, or feedback. First, the raw text is cleaned through preprocessing steps like tokenization (breaking text into words), removing unnecessary words (stopwords), and converting words to their base form. The text is then transformed into numerical data using methods like TF-IDF or word embeddings, which help capture the meaning and context. Once the text is prepared, machine learning or deep learning models are used to classify the sentiment based on the patterns identified in the data. The model outputs a sentiment score, ranging from highly negative to highly positive, which provides an understanding of the overall tone. This process enables organizations to analyze feedback at scale, gaining insights into customer opinions and attitudes.
